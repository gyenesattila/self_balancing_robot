Based on the simulations the most accurate Kalman filtering method is as follows:

- Filtering as often as possible (1:1 if possible)
- Using bias estimation ( A = [1 T; 0 1])
- Using A*P*A' everywhere (as opposed to : http://tom.pycke.be/mav/71/kalman-filtering-of-imu-data)
	- since the difference between the two estimations is ~0.1%, it still might be better to use the equations in the 		link, as there are two less matrix multiplications, and that could save time.
